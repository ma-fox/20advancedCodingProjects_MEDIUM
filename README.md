### The list:

> - [ ] Use a library to build an OAuth 2 authorization server. Implement the various flows according to the OAuth spec.
Scrape data from the web. Clean it up. Load it into a data analysis tool. Then, build some visualizations. For example, try making word clouds of Wikipedia articles.
>
> - [ ] Create a Dockerfile & docker-compose.yml for a web application with a database, cache layer, nginx/Apache server, backend API, & JavaScript frontend.
>
> - [ ] Write a bash/zsh script that traverses directories, iterates through files, and runs some commands against those files. Make sure the script can take arguments and settings flags.
>
> - [ ] Develop a frontend component that opens a popup, accepts user input, and passes the information back to the main page. Also, try developing an iframe that can be embedded on a site and pass information back.
>
> - [ ] Set a secure session cookie (server-only) that contains information about a user’s allowed actions as a JWT.
Pass sensitive information back and forth between two APIs, using an HMAC to sign the data.
>
> - [ ] Implement a Sudoku solver that uses concurrency/threads to quickly complete the matrix.
>
> - [ ] Implement a queue that supports popping from the left and right using manual memory allocation in a close-to-the-metal language.
>
> - [ ] Run regression models against census data to make predictions about the U.S. population.
>
> - [ ] Get a Raspberry Pi and implement a simple web server to turn on/off a light with an API request.
>
> - [ ] Write and orchestrate Airflow tasks to pull recent tweets from Twitter (using a schedule or a command), concurrently for various Twitter handles. 
>
> - [ ] Save the tweets to a data store. Bonus points for adding a map-reduce step for analysis.
>
> - [ ] Build a timeseries database and API for accepting and storing logs from an application. Handle concurrent requests with some type of queue. 
>
> - [ ] Implement Elasticsearch for quick searches.
>
> - [ ] Write and install your own simple program for the command line. Add your program to $PATH . Bonus points: host it online and support wget , curl , or even brew install
>
> - [ ] Deploy any/all of the above projects to a major cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, Digital Ocean, etc) and learn about how the various cloud services work together, provisioning instances, etc. See if you can set up CI/CD to the cloud. (Warning: this can be expensive if you’re not careful, so make sure you do your research!)
>
> - [ ] Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for your applications. Practice mocking, parametrization, and small tests that run quickly. Run the tests on a CI provider like CircleCI, TravisCI, Jenkins, etc.
>
> - [ ] Learn PostGIS and start running SQL commands against geospatial data. Return the data in GeoJSON format. Use something like MapboxJS to render the results.
>
> - [ ] Expose a GraphQL API for a data set. Or, add an Apollo data layer to a frontend project to buffer requests to a REST API.
>
> - [ ] Create an AI that always wins or draws at tic-tac-toe (never loses). Could use a simple min-max algorithm to win the game. Test your API programmatically with all possible user inputs (basically, play all possible games).
>
> - [ ] Write a program that opens an image, finds the most prevalent color, performs a flood fill on that color to another color, and writes the output. Now, make the program work concurrently on many images.
